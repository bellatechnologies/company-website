					<p>Every great story starts somewhere. Ours starts here.</p>
					<p>Bella Technologies is a micro business with one clear goal: help FinTech businesses build their SaaS products. Not websites. Not marketing campaigns. Software — the kind that keeps you competitive in one of the fastest-moving industries on the planet.</p>
					<p>India's FinTech market is on a trajectory that's hard to ignore. We're talking about a market expected to grow from $155 billion in 2025 to nearly $1 trillion by 2032. With an 87% FinTech adoption rate and leading the world in real-time payments, India isn't just participating in the global FinTech revolution — it's driving it.</p>
					<p>And yet, the businesses that power this ecosystem — IFAs, small NBFCs, insurance agents, lending platforms — are often running on spreadsheets and WhatsApp. The enterprise software vendors are too expensive. Custom builds are out of reach. That gap? That's exactly where we operate.</p>
					<p>We work with FinTech businesses across Payments, Lending, WealthTech, and InsurTech to build SaaS tools that are affordable, focused, and built for India's SMB reality. You focus on your customers and your compliance. We'll focus on the software.</p>
					<p>We're glad you're here. There's a lot more coming.</p>
