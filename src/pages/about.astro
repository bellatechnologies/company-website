					<p>
						We help FinTech businesses build software that keeps them
						competitive. Not websites. Not decks. Actual SaaS products — built
						for India's fast-moving FinTech reality.
					</p>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>Who we are</h2>
						<p>
							Bella Technologies is a founder-led software partner based in Tamil
							Nadu, India. We work as a trusted extension of your team — close
							enough to understand your workflows, experienced enough to know
							what good software looks like in practice.
						</p>
						<p>
							We're intentionally lean. That means no unnecessary overhead, no
							hand-offs, and a partnership that's built on honest communication
							and long-term thinking.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>What we do</h2>
						<p>
							We build SaaS tools for FinTech businesses across Payments,
							Lending, WealthTech, and InsurTech — with a focus on the SMBs that
							power India's ecosystem: IFAs, small NBFCs, lending platforms, and
							insurance agents.
						</p>
						<p>
							If critical workflows are still running on spreadsheets and
							WhatsApp, we can fix that. We build focused, affordable software
							that fits how your business actually operates — and keeps you
							audit-ready as you grow.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>How we work</h2>
						<p>
							Every engagement starts with understanding your process — where
							things slow down, where errors creep in, and what "working well"
							looks like for your team. We build in stages, so adoption is smooth
							and improvements show up early.
						</p>
						<p>
							We prefer long-term partnerships. Your business will keep evolving,
							and your software should keep up.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>What we believe</h2>
						<p>
							FinTech businesses don't need overengineered platforms or
							enterprise pricing. They need a trusted partner who understands
							their reality and builds software that's reliable, maintainable,
							and built to last. That's what we're here for.
						</p>

									goal: give FinTech SMBs access to practical, high-quality software
									— without the overhead of a large agency. When you work with
									Bella Technologies, you work with him directly.
