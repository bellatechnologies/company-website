						Bella Technologies is a founder-led custom software partner for
						Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), helping growth-stage
						businesses replace manual, spreadsheet-driven workflows with
						simple, reliable digital systems that actually fit how teams work
						day to day. We focus on workflow-first applications, dashboards,
						and API integrations that improve coordination, reduce errors, and
						give owners clearer visibility into their operations and cash flow.

					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>Who we are</h2>
						<p>
							Bella Technologies is a sole proprietorship based in Tamil Nadu,
							India, run by software consultant and engineer Maria Daniel
							Deepak. After more than 15 years working on B2B software and
							workflow-centric systems for small and medium businesses, he
							started Bella to give MSME founders access to practical,
							high-quality software without the overhead of a large agency. Our
							structure is intentionally lean, so clients work directly with an
							experienced engineer who understands both code and day-to-day MSME
							operations.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>What we do</h2>
						<p>
							We design and build custom, workflow-driven applications that
							replace error-prone spreadsheets and manual processes for MSMEs.
							Typical engagements include building internal tools, dashboards,
							and reconciliation workflows, integrating APIs between existing
							systems, and creating simple portals or apps that make it easier
							for teams to capture, track, and act on business data. We
							primarily serve tech-enabled NBFCs and small digital-lending
							MSMEs, but the same approach applies to any growth-stage business
							that needs its workflows to be more reliable, auditable, and
							easier to manage.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>How we work with clients</h2>
						<p>
							Our work starts with understanding your current process: how
							information flows, where delays and errors occur, and what "good"
							looks like for your team. From there, we design small, focused
							solutions that can be rolled out in stages, so your team can adopt
							them with minimal disruption while still seeing clear, measurable
							improvements. We prefer long-term partnerships on a retainer or
							ongoing engagement model, so we can keep refining the system,
							respond to changes in your business, and share what we have learned
							from similar MSME workflows.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="about-section">
						<h2>What we believe</h2>
						<p>
							We believe MSMEs do not need flashy technology; they need software
							that is trustworthy, maintainable, and aligned with how their
							business actually runs. That is why we prioritise clarity over
							jargon, honest communication over sales talk, and solutions that
							can be supported for years rather than quick, one-off builds. Our
							goal is to be a long-term, owner-driven partner for MSMEs, someone
							you can call when a process is breaking down, a workflow needs to
							scale, or a new opportunity requires your systems to catch up.
