# GitHub SSH Configuration

All GitHub-related git operations must use the 'github-bellatech' SSH configuration from `~/.ssh/config`.

## SSH Configuration Setup

Ensure your `~/.ssh/config` file contains the 'github-bellatech' host configuration:

```
Host github-bellatech
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_bellatech_key
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

## Git Operations

When performing any GitHub-related git operations, always use the SSH URL format with the configured host:

### Clone repositories:
```bash
git clone git@github-bellatech:organization/repo.git
```

### Set remote URLs:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github-bellatech:organization/repo.git
```

### Push/Pull operations:
Use standard git commands - the SSH config will automatically route through the 'github-bellatech' host.

## Verification

Test the SSH connection:
```bash
ssh -T github-bellatech
```

Expected output: `Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`

## AI Agent Instructions

- Always use `git@github-bellatech:` prefix for GitHub repository URLs
- Never use `git@github.com:` or `https://github.com/` URLs for GitHub operations
- When setting up new repositories or remotes, ensure they use the SSH config
- If SSH authentication fails, verify the SSH key is properly configured and added to the GitHub account
